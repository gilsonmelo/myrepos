rax-wordpress
=============
Note: This is still a work in progress. It is lacking a lot in terms of
documentation and styling.

This is cookbook with wrapper recipes to complete Rackspace's customer
WordPress deployment. Two versions of this deployment can be found here:


[multi](https://github.com/rackspace-orchestration-templates/wordpress-multi)
[single](https://github.com/rackspace-orchestration-templates/wordpress-single)

We aim to use as many community and public cookbooks as
possible to make this happen. This cookbook can be used to stand up a server
with Apache, PHP, MySQL, Varnish, vsftpd, hollandbackup, and lsync installed.
It will create a local user that can be used to move content via scp, sftp, or
ftp/ftps.

todo
====
* Provide documentation mapping out how attributes are consumed.
* Add tests
* Adding contribution guidelines
* Add support for CentOS

requirements
============
This cookbook is designed to be used on a Rackspace Cloud Server. All cookbooks
should work with Chef 11+ on Ubuntu.

recipes
=======
#### apache-prep
Updates parameters for Apache automatically based on the size of the server.

#### apache
Updates the WordPress Apache configuration in case the port used is not 80.
Creates SSL configuration if a cert and key are provided.

#### apache-prep
Adjusts Apache attributes based on the size of a server.  This should be put in
before `wordpress::default` in your run list.

#### default
Does nothing

#### firewall
Opens the firewall for http and potentially https traffic, typically run last.

#### lsyncd-client
Creates the .ssh directory for the WordPress user, installs the public SSH key.

#### lsyncd
Creates the .ssh directory for the WordPress user, installs the SSH private
key.

#### memcache
Installs and configures PHP's memcache module

#### memcached-firewall
Configures the firewall on the memcached server. Memcached requires no
authentication, so it's best to lock down access to the service.

#### mysql
Sets up /root/.my.cnf

#### user
Creates the admin user account, allowing the user to bypass the web installer.

#### varnish
Swaps out the default vcl with a vcl tailored for use with WordPress.

#### vsftpd
Handles additional configuration of vsftpd. Setup will setup FTPS and will
allow both FTP and FTPS by default.

#### wp-setup
Performs the initial install steps and creates the WordPress admin user.

#### x509
Installs SSL certs or generates self-signed certs if none are provided.
